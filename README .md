 # Bookstore Database Project

## Overview

This project involved designing and implementing a MySQL database for a bookstore. The database is designed to store and manage information about books, authors, customers, orders, and related data. The visual representation of the database model is provided in the drawio document

## Team Members and Roles

* **Brian:** Scheme/Model Designer
* **Macharia:** Developer
* **Mercy:** Tester

## Project Objectives

The primary goal was to create a relational database that efficiently stores all necessary data for a bookstore's operations. This included designing tables, establishing relationships between them, and ensuring data integrity. The database should allow for quick retrieval and analysis of data.

## Tools and Technologies

* **MySQL:** For building and managing the database.
* **Draw.io:** For visualizing the database schema and relationships .

## Database Schema

The database includes the following tables with their respective columns and relationships:

* **book**:
    * book\_id (INT, PRIMARY KEY)
    * isbn (VARCHAR(20), UNIQUE)

## SQL Code

The SQL code for creating the database and tables is provided in the sql file. It includes the following operations:

* Creating the database `Tech_Pack_Bookstore`.
* Creating tables with appropriate data types and constraints as defined in the schema.
* Defining primary and foreign keys to establish relationships between tables.
* Inserting sample data into the tables for testing purposes.

## Submission

The project is submitted as a GitHub repository.
